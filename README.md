# Exercise: John Doe's Resume

!NOTE! The "Jon Doe" is a placeholder for your first and last names.

## Introduction

In this activity, you will create a basic resume webpage using HTML. This activity will demonstrate that by understanding the fundamentals of HTML, you can construct actual web pages!

To preview your created app, simply click the "Go Live" button found in the VSCODE status bar. This will open your webpage in your browser.

If you are not using VSCode you can install and run the "live-server" npm package following the list of commands:

- [ ] Use `npm i live-server` to install the live-server package
- [ ] Use `npm run live-server` or `npx live-server --port=5551` to run the live-server. The port number should be 5551 strictly.
